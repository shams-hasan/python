# My Tic-Tac-Toe Game
This project allows for two people to engage in a tic-tac-toe game.


## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** Python

I built this game using Python logic and OOP. Particularly, I used boolean conditions, logical operators, and loops to help
run the methods as needed and ensure a fun game that can be played with functions similar to a real-life tic-tac-toe game. I decided to build a game using Python because it is a language made simple, and was my first ever language to introduce me to programming and the various concepts you could use to build applications for real-life usage. 

## Lessons Learned:

A Python bootcamp I completed emphasized putting skills into real-world projects rather than constantly ingesting new information - and that it is good to take a break to strengthen what you already know from time to time, rather than to keep going with learning. I agree with this advice 100% - it feels amazing to have done created something with the knowledge I obtained.
